function: Activation of long-chain fatty acids for both synthesis of cellular lipids, and degradation via beta-oxidation (Probable). Preferentially uses palmitate, palmitoleate, oleate, linoleate and eicosenoate as substrates (PubMed:12177484, PubMed:12366803). Can use myristate and linolenate as substrates (PubMed:12366803). Functions redundantly with LACS6 in lipid mobilization for beta-oxidation during seed germination, which is essential for postgerminative growth and seedling establishment (PubMed:14742880, PubMed:16844736).
catalytic activity: a long-chain fatty acid + ATP + CoA = a long-chain fatty acyl- CoA + AMP + diphosphate (RHEA:15421)
catalytic activity: ATP + CoA + decanoate = AMP + decanoyl-CoA + diphosphate (RHEA:33627)
catalytic activity: ATP + CoA + dodecanoate = AMP + diphosphate + dodecanoyl-CoA (RHEA:33623)
catalytic activity: ATP + CoA + tetradecanoate = AMP + diphosphate + tetradecanoyl-CoA (RHEA:33619)
catalytic activity: ATP + CoA + hexadecanoate = AMP + diphosphate + hexadecanoyl- CoA (RHEA:30751)
catalytic activity: (9Z)-octadecenoate + ATP + CoA = (9Z)-octadecenoyl-CoA + AMP + diphosphate (RHEA:33607)
catalytic activity: (9Z,12Z)-octadecadienoate + ATP + CoA = (9Z,12Z)- octadecadienoyl-CoA + AMP + diphosphate (RHEA:33651)
catalytic activity: (9Z,12Z,15Z)-octadecatrienoate + ATP + CoA = (9Z,12Z,15Z)- octadecatrienoyl-CoA + AMP + diphosphate (RHEA:44936)
cofactor: Mg(2+)
subunit: Interacts with PEX5.
disruption phenotype: Seedlings of the lacs6 and lacs7 double mutant were arrested in postgerminative growth due to inability to mobilize fatty acids for beta-oxidation, a necessary process to pursue the development.
